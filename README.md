How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

One way to interpret user needs is simply to ask clarifying questions about what the customer expects from the deliverable
product. Then, we take that feedback and rewrite that information into a user story, which can be thought of as a brief description
of what certain aspects of the program should be accomplishing, and what the user should be expecting on their end. Testers and developers can then take those user stories, and use it as a framework to create certain bits of software to fullfill the requirements and expectations of those user stories. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

The Agile process I hope to incorporate into how I create software is the iterative approach to writing and testing code. Constantly testing and refining small bits of my projects in increments will no doubt help me in finding bugs and other issues with my code early on in the process. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means having excellent written and verbal communication skills, being flexible to changes, being open and honest about the work you are doing and problems you are facing, and generally just being a decent and likeable person to be around.
